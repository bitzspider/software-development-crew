# software-development-crew

 This repository is based on the CrewAI framework, utilizing AI agents to develop software.
 
 The agents can read, write, and modify files in the software directory based on user prompts.

 The Shapes.html game, while very simple and not that fun...  was created entirely from prompts!

To use this repository, you will need to create a .env file with your own ChatGPT key, or use a local LLM which can be assigned to the agents.
